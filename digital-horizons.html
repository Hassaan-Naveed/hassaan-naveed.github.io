				 <h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
      	 <p>During the Digital Horizons week during teaching week 7, I went
           to a couple of events, totalling in approximately 6 hours of CPD
           hours. I attended the Google Assistant talk and the Google
           Asssistant technical challange.
      	 </p>

        <div>
         <h1><strong>Google Assistant Talk</strong></h1>
         <p>
           I attended the Google Assistant talk, which was held on the
           Wednesday of digital horizons week. This was of two parts: a talk
           by a Google Assistant developer, and a workshop.
         </p>
         <p>
           The talk was about how apps, also known as actions, are developed
           for the Google Assistant, and focused primarily on the rules and
           guidelines to keep in mind when developing one. For example, one
           was to always fully create a personality for the action and follow
           said personality, and always keep responses short.
         </p>
         <p>
           After the talk, there was a workshop session where we had to follow
           a short, hour long course on creating our own simple Google
           Assistant action. In order to do this we used the Google Dev Tools,
           and two add-on programs; FireBase and DialogueFlow. The action
           asked the user for their favourite colour and responded with the
           number of characters in the input.
         </p>

         <h1><strong>Google Assistant Technical Challenge</strong></h1>
         <p>
           I attended the Google Assistant Technical Challange on the
           Thursday of digital horizons week. This was a competition to
           create an action on the Google Assistant console using DialogueFlow,
           of a specific topic. The brief was to make an app that provided
           information on support services available at NTU when the Assisstant
           was asked.
         </p>
         <p>
           The session started with being placed in groups and being told the
           brief. Afterwards we were allowed to begin. We first began by
           planning the program out, defining each section of the brief as a
           goal. Then I started trying to create the program, while the rest
           of my group were helping by offering suggestions and performing
           research. I largely used the tutorial from the prior day but
           appliead it to the new scenario. We did not win the challenge due to
           facing an issue that took too long to solve, and therefore not
           having a complete program, but we came 2nd place in the room we were
           in.
