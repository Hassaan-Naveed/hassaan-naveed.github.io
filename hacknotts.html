				 <h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
      	 <p>HackNotts is a yearly Hackathon at the University of Nottingham,
           hosted by the HackSoc Society. It lasts 24 hours and hosts a
           variety of activieties, such as learning about hacking/programming
           and using git or creating teams to compete in various challanges
           during the 24 hour period. I participated to learn about how it
           works in order to be able to fully participate next year.

         <h1><strong>Morning</strong></h1>
         <p>
           We arrived at the UoN Junilee Campus at 10am where we had breakfast,
           we were then led to a lecture theatre at 11 to be given a
           presentation on how the day was going to work, and to meet the
           companies sponsoring the event. These included GitHub, Capital
           One, Netcraft, and Starling Bank.
         </p>
         <p>
           After this we went back to the main room where we then had to decide
           our teams and th eproject we were going to create. Each company had
           challanges, such as using their API to create something, but since
           we were new to hackathons and not everyone in our was experienced
           with programming, our group decided to do a simple program without
           competing.
         </p>

         <h1><strong>Afternoon</strong></h1>
         <p>
           Hacking began at 12. The program we decided to create was a
           slightly complex nickname generator in python, based on video
           game characters by the game director Hideo Kojima.
         </p>
         <p>
           We spent approximately 3-4 hours coding, following the structure of
           a paper questionnaire and translating it into python. We used pair
           programming, where one of us was coding while the others in our
           group were assisting. We took intermittent breaks to play various
           games that were provided, such as Super Smash Bros.
         </p>
			  </div>
				<div>
         <h1><strong>Evening</strong></h1>
         <p>
           We finished coding the program at approximately 4pm, and we stayed
           until 5pm before deciding to leave. Next year, when I have more
           experience, I will stay for th efull 24 hours and compete in the
           hackathon.
