				 <h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
      	 <p>
           The Nottingham Trent Students Union Warlocs Society focuses
           on tabletop gaming such as Role-Playing, Wargaming, Board games
           and Card games. Different sessions are held during the week for
           different activieties. I attend the Card and Board games session,
           held weekly on Thursdays from 6pm until 10pm.
         </p>

         <h1><strong>Card and Board Games</strong></h1>
         <p>
           The Card and Board Games night occurs every Thursday in the
           Students Union building at the City campus. There is a very wide
           selection of board games to play. I attend the board games session
					 almost every week, from 6pm until 10pm.
         </p>

					<h1><strong>Session 1</strong></h1>
					<p>
						The first session I went to was an introductory taster session
						during Freshers week. When I arrived I joined the group of
						people wanting to play board games. One of the selected a board
						game called Dixit, a game where a player selects one card from
						a hand of 5. All cards have some abstract artwork on them. They
						then place the card face down and say a single word or phrase. The
						other players must choose a card from their hands that best matches
						the word, and place them face down. The cards are then flipped
						over and all players have to guess which card was the original.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a few rounds of this, we decided to play some other games.
						The group split into two due to player restrictions on most other
						games. Our group opted to play Settlers of Catan: A strategy game
						where players must collect resources to build towns and cities on
						the board, and collect points to win the game. A single game of
						this lasted approximately 2.5 hours as we had to teach ourselves
						the rules.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h1><strong>Session 2</strong></h1>
					<p>
						During the second session I went to we decided to play a strategy
						board game called Small World. This game consisted of selecting a
						civilisation race, and competing for resource tiles on the game
						board, until the player owned too many tiles and couldnt expand any
						further. They would then abandon their original race and choose
						another to begin playing, however the original would remain on
						the board. The game was complex with many rules and took us a
						fairly long time to learn, a single game lasted 2-3 hours. After
						this we decided to play a simpler game of Dixit for the remainder
						of the session.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h1><strong>Session 3</strong></h1>
					<p>
						During the last session i went to we decided to play a strategy
						game called Takenoko. This game involved creating a bamboo garden
						by collecting and placing random tiles, and then growing and
						collecting bamboo pieces in order to complete various objectives,
						such as creating a certain formation of tiles or collecting a
						certain number and colour of bamboo. These objectives would then
						give the players points, which would be needed to win. This game
						lasted about 1 hour.
					</p>
					<p>
						After this, we decided to play a Role Playing
						board game called Betrayal at the House on the Hill. This game
						involved exploring a haunted house by choosing tiles from a
						shuffled deck, collecting items to prepare for the main game.
						Eventually one player wold be selected as a traitor who would be
						given a scenario to read from a game book privately, while the
						remaining players read an equivilant scenario from a different
						book. These would contain details of the scenario and how the
						traitors mechanics would work. The remaining players would then
						have to complete specific objectives throughout the house, while
						the traitor would be trying to complete their own objectives,
						directly opposing the player. During the game my character died
						very quickly. The game lasted about 2 hours.
					</p>
					<p>
						After this game ended we decided to play Settlers of Catan, which
						we had played previously. We played in pairs as we had too many
						people, and some wanted to leave early. I left after about 30 mins
						in order to get the bus.
